        <p>
            Hello Ni-Hao! I am a first-year student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, pursuing Master's degree in
            Human-Computer Interaction. I graduated from Boston University with a double major in journalism and
            advertising.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I am deeply passionate about UX design and the impact it has on how people interact with technology in the
            digital age. My journalism background gives me a deeper understanding of the world around me, and
            advertising
            has allowed me to think creatively and explore new ideas.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            I believe that UX design has the power to make a meaningful difference in the world and I am committed to
            using
            my skills and abilities in this field to make a positive change.
        </p>
