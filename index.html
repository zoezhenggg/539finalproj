            <h2>What is a documentary?</h2>
            <p>A documentary film or documentary is a non-fictional motion picture intended to "document reality,
                primarily for instruction, education or maintaining a historical record."</p>

                <h3>Poetic</h3>
                <img src="images/olympia1.jpeg" alt="The picture of the documentary Olympia">
                <p>A poetic documentary eschews linear continuity in favor of mood, tone, or the juxtaposition of
                    imagery. Since poetic documentaries often have little or no narrative content, the director of
                    photography is often asked to capture highly composed, visually striking images that can tell a
                    story without additional verbal context. Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia (1938) is an example of a poetic
                    documentary that focuses on visuals and artistic style to help reveal an inner truth.</p>

                <h3>Expository</h3>
                <img src="images/dust_bowl.jpg" alt="The picture of the documentary The Dust Bowl">
                <p>Expository documentaries set up a specific point of view or argument about a subject and often
                    feature “voice of God” style voice-over. For expository documentaries, the cinematographer is
                    responsible for collecting footage that supports and strengthens the spoken argument of the film,
                    including stock footage, archival footage, b-roll, or re-enactments of historical events. The Dust
                    Bowl (2012) is filmmaker Ken Burns’ historical account of the disastrous drought that occurred
                    during the Great Depression.</p>

                <h3>Participatory</h3>
                <img src="images/bowling.jpg" alt="The picture of the documentary Bowling for Columbine">
                <p>Participatory documentaries are defined by the interaction between the documentary filmmakers and
                    their subject. Therefore, a cinematographer is equally responsible for capturing the interviewer as
                    he is the interviewee. Participatory documentaries, also known as interactive documentaries, often
                    present the filmmaker’s version of the truth as “the” truth, focusing on direct engagement with
                    subjects and capturing real emotional responses and interactions. Many of the interactions that are
                    captured support the filmmaker’s point of view or prove the film’s intent. Many of Michael Moore’s
                    documentaries, like Bowling for Columbine (2001), are participatory but also blend elements of
                    observational and performative modes.</p>

                <h3>Observational</h3>
                <img src="images/primary.jpg" alt="The picture of the documentary Primary">
                <p>A style of documentary embraced by the cinema verité movement, observational documentaries attempt to
                    discover the ultimate truth of their subject by acting as a fly-on-the-wall—in other words,
                    observing the subject’s real-life without interrupting. Cinematographers on observational
                    documentaries will often be asked to be as unobtrusive as possible in order to capture their
                    subjects in a raw, unguarded state. An example of this direct cinema type of documentary is Primary
                    (1960), a film chronicling the Wisconsin primary between John F. Kennedy and Hubert H. Humphrey.</p>

                    alt="The picture of the documentary Man With a Movie Camera">
                <p>Reflexive documentaries focus on the relationship between the filmmaker and the audience. Since the
                    subject matter is often the process of documentary filmmaking itself, a cinematographer will shoot
                    behind-the-scenes style footage of the entire film production process, including editing,
                    interviewing, and post-production. Dziga Vertov’s reflexive documentary Man With a Movie Camera
                    (1929) made history with its actor-less presentation of urban Soviet life.</p>

                <h3>Performative</h3>
                <img src="images/supersize_me.jpeg" alt="The picture of the documentary Supersize Me">
                <p>Performative documentaries focus on the filmmaker’s involvement with their subject, using his or her
                    personal experience or relationship with the subject as a jumping-off point for exploring larger,
                    subjective truths about politics, history, or groups of people. A cinematographer is often asked to
                    capture the documentary production process, as well as intimate footage that illustrates the direct
                    and often personal relationship between filmmaker and subject. Supersize Me (2004) by filmmaker
                    Morgan Spurlock documents his experience eating only McDonald’s fast food for 30 days, chronicling
                    the body issues, health problems, and the ensuing doctor’s visits in an attempt to question the food
                    sold at the famous fast-food chain.</p>
