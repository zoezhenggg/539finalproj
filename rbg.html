        <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p><br>
        <p><strong>Director:</strong></p>
        <p>Julie Cohen, Betsy West</p><br>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>The exceptional life and career of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has
            developed
            a breathtaking legal legacy while becoming an unexpected pop culture icon.</p><br>
        <p><strong>My reason for recommending: </strong></p>
        <p>I didn't know RBG too well until her pass. This documentary gave me a in-depth demonstration of her life
            since she was young. As a woman, I appreciate how much she has done to our society in the area of human
            rights, gender equality, and for women. I recommend to everyone who is interested in the social justice
            issue of equality.</p>
